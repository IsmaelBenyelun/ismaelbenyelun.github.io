I am completing a Ph.D. in **Aerospace Engineering** at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Spain), inside the Computational Mechanics group. My main research topics are **topology optimization** algorithms and **data-driven** techniques, using **surrogate models** to speed up expensive evaluations in physical and engineering applications. During my last year of my Ph.D., I did a half-a-year research stay at the [CSMLab](https://www.csmlab.org/), led by Prof. Fehmi Cirak at **University of Cambridge** (UK), and another half-a-year research stay at the [DYSCO](https://pimm.artsetmetiers.fr/equipes/dysco) team, under the supervision of Prof. Paco Chinesta at **École nationale supérieure d'Arts et Métiers** (France).
